# Pathfinding-Visualizer

This application allows you to visualize and interact with the A* Search Algorithm. Pressing 'x' closes the program, 'c' clears the board, 'UP' enlarges the board, 'DOWN' dwindles the size of the board, and 'SPACE' starts the visualization. You can add and remove barriers, the start node, and the end node by clicking the squares on the grid.
